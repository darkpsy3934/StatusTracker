## 1.0.0-beta-1

**Summary:**
This is the first beta release of StatusTracker, an addon designed to enhance your situational awareness in World of Warcraft. It provides real-time alerts and information about your character's health, mana, and threat level.

**New Features:**

* **Health and Mana Alerts:**
    - Audible alerts for low health (below 35%) and low mana (below 20%).

* **Aggro Tracker:**
    - Real-time threat monitoring for both tanks and DPS/other roles.
    - Colored text indicators for different threat states.
    - Tank-specific information includes main tank/off-tank status and threat transitions.

**Improvements:**

* **Threat Smoothing:** Improved threat transition detection for tanks to reduce alert flickering.

**Known Issues:**

* **Customization UI:** A dedicated options panel for configuring alerts and other settings is not yet available. This feature will be implemented in a future update.
* **Cooldown Tracker:** The cooldown tracker feature is currently disabled due to ongoing development and testing. We expect to reintroduce it in an upcoming release with enhanced functionality.
* **Pet Health Alert:** Pet health tracking is still under development. The current version provides basic chat messages about low pet health, but more comprehensive alerts will be added later.
* **Additional Tank Alerts:**  More granular threat information for tanks (e.g., "Threatened" vs. "Secure" aggro) will be added in future updates.

**Beta Testing Focus:**

* **Aggro Tracker Feedback:** We're particularly interested in feedback on the aggro tracker's accuracy and responsiveness in various situations.
* **Bug Reports:**  Please report any bugs or compatibility issues you encounter.
